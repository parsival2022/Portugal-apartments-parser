This parser was created for the person who wanted to start real estate business in Portugal. He wanted to watch the market and analise tendencies. My task was to create a parser itself for major real estate marketplaces and implement API for parsed data analising. Later I also added simple React frontend. 
This is early - and raw - version. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal the final project with all of its details and parsing strategies, but I hope you can get the overall impression. Only one parser for Imovirtual is present, basic data analise is implemented. I tried to create interactive page using python template system and Vanilla JS, wich is, obviously, the bicycle inventing but still fun. I think I would develope this project in the future, so stay tuned! And if you want to participate - you`re welcome!
